# Whats App Analysis
The code provided uses Python, a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. The types of coding used in the provided code snippet:

Data Manipulation (Python Pandas):Python's Pandas library is utilized for data manipulation tasks such as creating and modifying DataFrames (tabular data structures).
In this code, Pandas functions like pd.DataFrame() and pd.to_datetime() are used to create a DataFrame from a dictionary and convert the 'Date' column to datetime format, respectively.

Data Visualization (Plotly Express):Plotly Express is a Python library used for creating interactive data visualizations, including charts and graphs.
The px.bar() function from Plotly Express is employed to generate a bar chart visualization, with the 'Date' column as the x-axis and the 'Messages' column as the y-axis.

Data Representation:The provided data is represented using a dictionary, where each key-value pair represents a column of the DataFrame.The DataFrame created from this data serves as the basis for visualization and further analysis.
Control Flow:Although not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, control flow structures such as loops or conditionals may be used in more complex scenarios to control the execution flow of the program.Control flow allows for decision-making and repetitive tasks, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the code.

Declarative Coding: Declarative coding emphasizes what should be achieved rather than how it should be done.In this code, Plotly Express functions like px.bar() and Pandas methods such as DataFrame creation (pd.DataFrame()) operate in a declarative manner. They specify what kind of visualization or data structure is desired without explicitly detailing the steps to achieve it.

Imperative Coding:While not explicitly present in this code, imperative coding involves providing step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish a task.Imperative coding might involve explicit loops or conditionals to iterate over data or execute specific actions.

Functional Coding:Functional coding focuses on the use of functions to perform tasks and transform data.Pandas' DataFrame operations and Plotly Express functions can be considered functional as they transform data or generate visualizations based on function calls.

Procedural Coding:Procedural coding involves organizing code into procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.Although not apparent in this snippet, procedural coding might be used in more complex scenarios to structure the analysis process into reusable procedures or functions.
